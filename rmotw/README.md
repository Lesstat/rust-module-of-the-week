# MOTW Examples

Ah, there you are traveller! Come inside, hang up your coat, put your feet by the fire, and I shall bring you what you desire: the code samples from [Rust Module of the Week](https://motw.rs).

## Running an example

Step zero: [Acquire Rust](https://rustup.rs/) if you haven't already.

First step, acquire code.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/slyons/rust-module-of-the-week
```

Second step, run example!

```shell
cd rmotw
cargo run --example std_fs_1
```

Where `std_fs_1` can be substituted for any of the filenames (minus the `.rs`) in the [examples](./examples) directory.

## Going forward

The structure of these examples may change in the future (into indepdendent submodules) but that's next week's problem.
