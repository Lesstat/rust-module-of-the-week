Welcome back to to MOTW! This week, we'll be continuing from [part 1]({filename}/2021-08-01-rmotw.md), exploring some more of `std::fs`. Let's see what Rudgal has been up to!

# The story so far

[Rudgal The Delirious](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/dnd-orc-names.php) is the local Ornithologist. Armed with his trusty camera he's been tasked by the local Government to catalog and identify all of the birds in his local area. As he has to identify not only the species but the individual birds he's ended up with quite a few photos!

Last week Rudgal had laid the groundwork for his photo-reoganizing project. Files were filtered, directories recursed. But not *that* kind of curse. Yet.
